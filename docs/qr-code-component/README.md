## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

This project didn't require flexbox or CSS grid. I look forward to using them in future projects when it makes sense to do so.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) - CSS Custom Properties - This helped me simplify the solution by putting all the design mandated selections into variables that I could use throughout the CSS. This sets everything up so that if a design choice is changed later, I'll only need to reset the custom property in :root instead of throughout the CSS.
