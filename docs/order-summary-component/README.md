## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learned position, flexbox, background properties, and also box-shadow property. I always forgot to use box-shadow and can't use it.

### Continued development

This project didn't require CSS Grid. I look forward to using them in future projects when it makes sense to do so.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) - This helped me simplify the solution by putting all the design mandated selections into variables that I could use throughout the CSS. This sets everything up so that if a design choice is changed later, I'll only need to reset the custom property in :root instead of throughout the CSS.
- [CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing complete guide that explains everything about flexbox, focusing on all the different possible properties for the parent element (the flex container) and the child elements (the flex items). It also includes history, demos, patterns, and a browser support chart.
- [background-position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position) - This helped me to understand the background position property simply and quickly.

-The above three videos explain box-shadow property easily, simply, and completely. Before I found his videos, I absolutely didn't understand them.
